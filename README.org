#+TITLE: BCG: The Bingo Card Generator

* Motivation
Do you ever have a list of strings that you wished was a bingo card? Well here you go.

* Usage
Reads possibilities from "input.txt" (delimited by newlines) and writes a table to "index.html". An example input file is included for reference

* Todo
- Add some styling to the table
- Add javascript(?) to allow the buttons to be clicked on/scored out
- Allow for creation of multiple cards and come up with a naming convention
